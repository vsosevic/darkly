You can see the cookie "I_am_admin". If we decrypt the value using md5 rule we would have '68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327 = false'.

Lets try to decrypt the world 'true' uing md5 rule 'true = b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09' and copy 'b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09' to the value 'I_am_admin'.

Here we are.
